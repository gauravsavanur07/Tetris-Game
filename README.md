# Tetris AI

### Overview

Source code for CS3243 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence project. The project's objective is to create and train an AI for the game Tetris. Our implementation employs Genetic Algorithm with several enhancements including Thread Pool and Look-Ahead technique. A Tetris simulator is also provided to give visualization of performance of the AI.

The AI is capable of scoring millions of lines given random sequence of pieces. Detail report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLzTAvbQ_LZtmOkrmQT0lQ6Rz2sCSoWBRdTuV5zKxbA/edit?usp=sharing).
